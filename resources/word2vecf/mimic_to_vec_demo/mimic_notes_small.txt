on presentation initial physical examination revealed temperature was 0 degrees fahrenheit heart rate was 0 blood pressure was 0 following administration of 0 liters of normal saline respiratory was 0 and his oxygen saturation was 0 on 0 liters nasal cannula his heart had a regular rate and rhythm there were normal first and second heart sounds there was a 0 systolic ejection murmur and there were no rubs or gallops his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally his abdomen was soft nontender and nondistended and there were hypoactive bowel sounds he had a palpable bypass graft pulse dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally and his surgical incision was clean dry and intact please note that the above examination was done by the vascular surgery team which was the team that was initially planning to admit the patient to the hospital pertinent laboratory data on presentation on initial laboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell count of 0 hematocrit was 0 and platelets were 0 his pt was 0 ptt was 0 and inr was 0 his serum chemistries revealed sodium was 0 potassium was 0 chloride was 0 bicarbonate was 0 blood urea nitrogen was 0 creatinine was 0 and

pending but ultimately grew out yeast a sputum culture taken on admission was also initially pending but ultimately also grew out yeast radiology imaging his admission chest x ray demonstrated stable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery no focal areas of consolidation overall stable appearance of the chest compared with a study no radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia his admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm nonspecific inferior lateral t wave changes low qrs voltages in the limb leads and t wave changes in v 0 and v 0 when compared with an electrocardiogram dated an initial abdominal ct was a limited noncontrast examination that demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications no evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid incompletely imaged coronary artery calcification a simple left renal cyst sigmoid diverticulosis and an enlarged and partially calcified prostate gland hospital_course_by_system 0 cardiovascular the patient was initially admitted to the vascular intensive care unit with hypotension decreased urine output and acute renal failure most likely secondary to a presumed gram negative urosepsis although there were never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis while boarding in the medical intensive care unit on the night of admission the patient had a sudden cardiorespiratory arrest he was resuscitated with epinephrine lidocaine and direct current cardioversion times four he was also intubate for airway protection following these measures the patient returned to a sinus rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 0 the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to the return of a pulse was approximately 0 minutes he subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood pressure an echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0 to 0 in the setting of tachycardia and a hyperdynamic right ventricle suggesting elevated right sided filling pressures although the definitive etiology of this arrest remained unknown the most likely trigger was a non q wave myocardial infarction as his troponin values were elevated to greater than 0 following his arrest a repeat echocardiogram done on demonstrated mild left atrial dilation an ejection fraction of 0 to 0 resting regional wall motion abnormalities including inferior mid and apical left ventricular akinesis depressed right ventricular systolic function and moderate mitral regurgitation compared with the prior study of the left ventricular function was unchanged there was moderate mitral regurgitation and the right ventricular function appeared worse on the patient was loaded with amiodarone and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone the following day he was started on heparin intravenously given his elevated serum troponin to greater than 0 this medication was continued for 0 hours given his elevated troponins and non q wave myocardial infarction the patient was a candidate for cardiac catheterization after discussions between the medical intensive care unit team and the patient s family however the decision was made to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the patient had been made do not resuscitate do not intubate following the resuscitation mentioned above and his family no longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures by he was off pressors and he was restarted on a beta blocker and ace inhibitor at low doses on the evening of the patient complained of substernal chest pain that was relieved by npg_sl and morphine he also had st segment depressions in v 0 and v 0 that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain therefore the patient was again started on heparin although this was discontinued on when the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes he again had substernal chest pain on although he had no electrocardiogram changes and he again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes by hospital day four the patient began to develop evidence of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid resuscitation and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun by the time of his transfer to the general medicine service on the patient was still significantly volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid resuscitation in the medical intensive care unit therefore he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that he was having signs and symptoms of right sided congestive heart failure he achieved adequate diuresis by the time of his discharge to rehabilitation as his oxygen saturation was greater than 0 on 0 liters nasal cannula 0 infectious_disease sepsis the patient was started on gentamicin and piperacillin tazobactam in addition to the levofloxacin metronidazole and vancomycin he was already taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram negative urosepsis and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous fluids on his levofloxacin and metronidazole was discontinued and he was started on fluconazole given the growth of yeast on urine culture he was taken off of gentamicin on hospital day three and his fluconazole was discontinued on hospital day five as per the infectious disease service he was taken off of vancomycin on and his piperacillin tazobactam was discontinued on despite the presumption of a gram negative urosepsis precipitating this admission the patient did not have any positive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of yeast in two urine cultures noted above he remained afebrile both before and after discontinuation of his antibiotics and he was found to be clostridium difficile negative on 0 pulmonary as noted above the patient was intubated and he was extubated on he subsequently developed wheezing and mild hypoxia most likely secondary to cardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his aggressive fluid resuscitation he was gently diuresed toward the end of his hospitalization and by the time of his he was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 0 on 0 liters nasal cannula intermittent ipratropium nebulizers and chest physical therapy for clearance of his respiratory secretions 0 renal the patient presented with acute renal failure and prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid resuscitation by the time of discharge his serum creatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline 0 nutrition the patient was found to be profoundly malnourished with a serum albumin of 0 on admission once he was extubated and taking orals he performed poorly on a modified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin liquid ground solid diet with whole medication tablets small bites and sips upright posture with meals and aspiration precautions he was also given promod shakes with and between meals for nutritional supplementation of his heart healthy diabetic diet 0 vascular the patient s operative incisions and foot ulcers continued to heal throughout this

operating room for living donor kidney transplant performed by dr and assisting by dr please see details of this surgery in operating room note also during her operating room time the patient also had a right iliac artery thrombosis it was noted that at the end of the completion of the procedure that she had an ischemic appearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse in the operation there was some difficulty with arterial anastomosis renal artery to the left iliac artery and dr came to assist dr again please see details of that operation in the operative report postoperatively the patient went to the intensive care unit the patient had an a line a central line foley she was placed on a heparin drip to keep ptt between 0 and 0 the patient s dressing was clean dry and intact the patient had 0 drains in place good femoral pulse and good dorsalis pedis pulse these pulses were palpable the patient was making good urine output postoperatively renal was consulted and made recommendations postoperatively the patient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable renal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance of the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and resistive disease ranging from 0 to 0 throughout on postoperative day number one the patient had another ultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they wanted to rule out hematoma the ultrasound demonstrated that there was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted kidney the transplanted kidney is minimally changed from yesterday which was on with a small amount of pelvic ectasis relatively unchanged resistive indices the patient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit her heparin was discontinued on the patient received 0 cc per cc of

evidence of right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis on wbc was 0 hematocrit of 0 also on pt was 0 ptt was 0 inr of 0 sodium that day was 0 and 0 bun creatinine of 0 and 0 with a glucose of 0 vascular surgery continued to see the patient it was decided that hematocrit was stable that heparin could be continued the patient was restarted on heparin the patient still complained of right foot numbness but it was about the same and not worse she was continued on all of her immunosuppressive medications including tacrolimus valcyte cellcept bactrim solu medrol the patient was transitioned from heparin to coumadin the patient was transferred to the floor continued to make excellent urine output the patient had another ultrasound on because there was blood in her drain and with the decreasing hematocrit ultrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color blood flow and wave form with normal residual indices 0 by 0 cm fluid collection likely simply fluid anterior to the contrast focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral aspect of the mid pole probably which demonstrates normal blood flow and may represent artifact however attention to this area on a follow up

extremity greater than left lower extremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the right iliac artery this demonstrated acute deep venous thrombosis within the right common femoral and

him slumped onto the floor apparently unable to talk and with weakness in his right arm and leg ems was called and he was brought into the emergency department at the patient has not had strokes or

pressure was initially controlled with a nipride drip to keep the cephalic pressure between 0 the nipride drip was then weaned as labetalol iv was added along with a nicardipine drip the patient was also given dilantin load followed by a maintenance dose of 0 mg q d his level has been therapeutic around 0 considerations for a cta and angiogram for possible avm or aneurysm were considered but the patient s renal function and health status did not allow such studies to be done at the current time repeated noncontrast ct of the head revealed no increase in the bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral edema with some pressure onto the brain stem the patient s neurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he only had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal reflexes in addition he had a gag reflex however he began to not move any extremities and not respond to any noxious stimuli in the four extremities by 0 p m on his neurological condition deteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and nonreactive he lost gag and corneal reflex calorics were done at this time which revealed no response neurosurgery was reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt that the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in that it would not help him mannitol was then started along with hyperventilation to keep the pc 0 below 0 in an attempt to decrease the cerebral edema despite clinical examination that the patient is clinically brain dead the family wishes to continue aggressive treatment the family requested that the patient be transferred to the however dr at the stroke service said that the patient would not be accepted at the given that there would be no other intervention that would be done differently at 0 cardiovascular as mentioned above the patient was initially started on a nipride drip to control the blood pressure between 0 however he was slowly weaned off the nipride to be switched over to cardene drip the cardene drip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p o labetalol three serial cks and troponins were checked and found to be negative thus ruling the patient out for a myocardial infarction 0 pulmonary the patient was initially intubated when first seen down in the emergency room for airway protection since he vomited he then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia on the chest x ray he was started on levofloxacin and flagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia vancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization due to sputum cultures showing staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive organisms and gram negative rods susceptibilities are still pending the patient did have one or two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials and increased secretion in his nostrils in an attempt to decongest him saline nasal spray was started 0 renal acute renal failure secondary to dehydration the patient s creatinine upon admission was 0 and continued to rise to 0 as he started third spacing his fluids urine electrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 0 which is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and prerenal he was subsequently given iv fluids and his creatinine improved to 0 a renal ultrasound was done which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis 0 infectious_disease leukocytosis given the aspiration pneumonia and elevated white count of 0 levofloxacin and flagyl were started on the day of admission blood cultures were obtained the first two sets showed one out of four blood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase negative since this was deemed a contaminent no further antibiotics were given however on day number four of hospitalization his sputum culture returned showing staphylococcus coagulase positive organisms so vancomycin was added more blood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date 0 gastrointestinal the patient was given and orogastric tube for tube feeds he had some high residuals so the tube feeds were stopped reglan was then administered to promote gi motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted 0 fluids electrolytes and_nutrition hyponatremia the patient s sodium slowly fell from 0 upon admission to 0 on the fourth day of hospitalization it was felt that this was due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was then fluid restricted although he has acute renal failure secondary to dehydration and third spacing it was felt that he needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall hyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting
